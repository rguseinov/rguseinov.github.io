I am a 4-th year BA Political Science student at HSE University (Moscow campus). I am working on a Bachelor thesis in studying the influence of revolutionary mass uprisings on regime change in a cross-country perspective under the supervision of Prof. Andrey Korotayev and consultaions of Prof. Jonathan Pinckney, University of Texas at Dallas. Prof. Jack Goldstone from George Mason University has agreed to be the reviewer of the thesis.

I am also working as a Research Assistant at the Center for Stability and Risks Analysis, a research center which conducts systemic monitoring of socio-political transformation in a regional and global perspective. I am a project team member that studies economic consequences of revolutions using quasi-experimental approach and work in a reserch group on security studies. 

Besides, I am working as a social studies, history and political science teacher for school students at different schools and organizations (including CPM Private School, one of the best schools in Russia).

My research interests lie in the intersection of comparative politics of authoritarian regimes, social and mass movements, applying advanced quantitative methods in political science and causal inference.
